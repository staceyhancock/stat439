Each week, classes will be a mix of lecture, class discussion, and short activities. 

*  **You should bring your laptop with you to every class period.** We will be using R and RStudio extensively in this course. In particular, students are encouraged to write homework assignments in R Markdown and compile to pdf for the submission.
* Assigned readings for each week are posted. Whether you learn better by reading prior to lecture, or hearing a lecture prior to reading is up to you.
* Weeks will typically alternate between homework assignments and in class quizzes, with both homework due dates and quizzes falling on Thursdays. 
    - Homework assignments should be submitted in D2L by 5pm on the due date. 
    - Quizzes will be taken in class.
